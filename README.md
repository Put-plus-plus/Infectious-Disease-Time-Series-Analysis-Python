## Description 
Using a neural network for time series analysis. The project involves processing the data so that the format is conducive for downstream analysis. Then go on and build a neural network and train the model, and then test out new images to see if the trained model works??. 

The `DataPrep` class has method for reading in a zip file (method),  and for cleaning and filtering allowed values (methods). The `NeuralNetwork` class has methods for test and train method using a time stemp to split the data (method), for defining the  structure recursive artifical neural model (method),  and for training the model and evaluating its performance (method).   

## Dependencies

## Execution - Infectious Disease Example
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Animation - Infectious Disease Example
remember to add the link to the GIF, which I must also make sure to add to the repo, see stackoverflow - not sure if I add the prediction
